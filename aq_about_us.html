			This webpage was designed and created by Michael Gustin(left) and Issam Himmi(right). We are computer science students at the University of St. Thomas and this website was created for our 
			Web Development class. The purpose of it is to create a map that will update when prompted with the latest measurements of air pollutants.
			The user is also able to filter their results by selecting either a time frame or a particular pollutant. The map will automatically update whenever the user pans across it or selects a new
			location with the input box. In order to create this website, we used the Open AQ API as well as the Leaflet API. The Leaflet API provided us with a map and a set of methods with which we were able to 
			create things such as markers and dynamically zoom and relocate the focus of the map. With the Open AQ API, we were able to retrieve the latest measurements of air quality from locations around the world. 
			With this information, we made a table that would dynamically change based on the location of the map focus and would show which pollutants were affected which areas and how severe these pollutants were.
			Lastly, we used the framework Vue.js to organize and request information from the API's. It was an effective way to reduce the redundancy as well as keep our program modular.
